        <h1>The Causes and Consequences of Migration in Pakistan</h1>
        <p>Migration, both internal and international, is a common phenomenon in Pakistan. Economic instability, security concerns, and lack of job opportunities drive many people to migrate.</p>
        
        <h2>Internal Migration</h2>
        <p>Rural-to-urban migration is increasing as individuals move to cities in search of better education, healthcare, and employment opportunities.</p>
        
        <h2>International Migration</h2>
        <p>Internationally, many Pakistanis migrate to countries like the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and the UK for better economic prospects. While migration can lead to improved living standards for individuals and remittance inflows to Pakistan, it also creates labor shortages in key sectors back home.</p>
        
        <h2>Solutions</h2>
        <p>Addressing root causes like unemployment, political instability, and lack of infrastructure development can help reduce forced migration. Government initiatives focusing on skill development and entrepreneurship can encourage citizens to build sustainable careers within Pakistan.</p>
