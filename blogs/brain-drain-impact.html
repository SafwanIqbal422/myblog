        <h1>The Impact of Brain Drain on Pakistan's Economy</h1>
        <p>Brain drain, or the emigration of skilled professionals from Pakistan, has a significant impact on the nation's economic and social progress. Many professionals leave in search of better job opportunities, higher salaries, and improved living conditions.</p>
        
        <h2>Economic Impact</h2>
        <p>This results in a loss of valuable human capital, leading to gaps in industries such as healthcare, engineering, and IT. One of the key reasons for brain drain is the lack of competitive salaries and career growth opportunities within Pakistan.</p>
        
        <h2>Contributing Factors</h2>
        <p>Additionally, political instability and economic uncertainty further drive professionals to seek stability abroad. The combination of these factors creates a challenging environment for retaining talent.</p>
        
        <h2>Potential Solutions</h2>
        <p>To address this issue, Pakistan needs to improve job prospects, offer competitive salaries, and create an environment that encourages skilled workers to stay and contribute to national development. Government initiatives like research funding, professional incentives, and remote work opportunities can help retain talent within the country.</p>
